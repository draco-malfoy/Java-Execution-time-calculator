Java - Excecution time calculator

Big notation has always been with us when we needed to determine which method/algorithm is time efficient.
But sometimes, even after knowing the time complexity of methods doesn't provide satifaction to the need of 
precise numbers of the actual execution time. 
Sometimes, we crave for the actual time taken or time difference between two methods/algorithms.
Hence the need of this tool.

Although the resultant time may not be same all the time (MicroBenchmarking and stuffs), depending upon JIT, warm-up phase, measurement phase, platorm under consideration, garbage collection time, etc., this should give a pretty close execution time.
